# Line-by-Line Breakdown

```
class Solution {
```

This line starts the definition of a class named Solution. In object-oriented programming, classes serve as blueprints for creating objects. This is a common structure for coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode.

```
public:
```

The public keyword is an access specifier. It indicates that the members (functions and variables) declared after it can be accessed from outside the class.

```
int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
```

This line defines the function removeElement.

```int```: Specifies that the function will return an integer value, which in this case is the new size of the vector after removal.

```removeElement```: This is the name of the function.

```vector<int>& nums```: This is the first parameter. It's a reference to a vector of integers. Using a reference (&) means the function operates directly on the original nums vector passed to it, rather than on a copy. Any changes made inside the function persist outside of it.

```int val``` :This is the second parameter, an integer representing the value to be removed from the vector.

```
for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
```

This line starts a for loop to iterate through the vector.

```int i = nums.size() - 1```: The loop variable i is initialized to the index of the last element of the vector. If a vector has n elements, their indices range from 0 to n-1.

```i >= 0```: This is the loop condition. The loop continues as long as i is greater than or equal to 0, ensuring that the loop processes all elements from the end to the beginning.

```i--```: The loop update statement. After each iteration, i is decremented by 1, moving the loop backward through the vector. Iterating backward is crucial because when you erase an element from a std::vector, all subsequent elements shift forward, invalidating any forward-moving iterators or indices.  By iterating backward, you avoid this issue as the elements you've yet to process remain at valid indices.

```
if (nums[i] == val) {
```

This line is a conditional if statement that checks if the element at the current index i is equal to the target value val.

```
nums.erase(nums.begin() + i);
```

This line executes if the if condition is true. It erases the element at the current position.

```nums.erase()```: This is a method of the std::vector class used to remove one or more elements.

```nums.begin() + i```: This calculates an iterator pointing to the element at index i. nums.begin() returns an iterator to the first element, and adding i to it moves the iterator to the i-th element.

```
}
```
This bracket closes the if statement.

```
}
```
This bracket closes the for loop.

```
return nums.size();
```

After the loop finishes, this line returns the new size of the modified vector. The size() method returns the number of elements currently in the vector.
