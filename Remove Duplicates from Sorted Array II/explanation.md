# Line-by-Line Explanation

This problem asks you to remove duplicates from a sorted array such that each element appears at most twice. The code modifies the input array in-place and returns the new length of the array.
The code uses a reverse loop to iterate through the array and remove duplicate elements that appear more than twice.

Class and Function Definition

```
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
```
```class Solution { ... }```: This defines a class named Solution. In many online coding platforms, the provided solution must be wrapped in a class.

```public:```: This access specifier indicates that the members that follow are accessible from outside the class.

```int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums)```: This is the function signature.

```int```: The function returns an integer, which will be the new length of the array after removing duplicates.

```removeDuplicates```: The name of the function.

```vector<int>& nums```: The function takes a reference to a vector of integers named nums. The & symbol means it's a reference, which allows the function to modify the original vector directly without creating a copy. This is essential for an "in-place" solution.

The Main Logic: Iteration and Removal

```
    for(int i=nums.size()-3; i>=0; i--){
```
This is a for loop that iterates backward through the nums vector.

```int i=nums.size()-3```: The loop starts at the index i which is three positions from the end of the array. The reason for this is to safely check nums[i+2] in the subsequent line. By starting at nums.size() - 3, the last element you check will be nums[0], and the last element you can compare it to is nums[2].

```i>=0```: The loop continues as long as i is greater than or equal to 0, ensuring the entire array is checked.

```i--```: The loop decrements i by 1 in each iteration, moving backward.

The Conditional Check and Removal

```
            if (nums[i]==nums[i+2])
            {
                 nums.erase(nums.begin() + (i+2));
            }
```
```if (nums[i]==nums[i+2])```: This is the core condition. It checks if an element at index i is equal to the element at index i+2. Since the array is sorted, if nums[i] and nums[i+2] are the same, it implies that the elements at nums[i], nums[i+1], and nums[i+2] are all the same. This means the element appears at least three times.

```nums.erase(nums.begin() + (i+2))```: If the condition is true, this line removes the element at nums[i+2].

```nums.erase()```: This is the vector's built-in function to remove an element.

```nums.begin() + (i+2)```: This expression calculates an iterator to the element at index i+2. The nums.begin() returns an iterator to the first element, and adding an integer to it moves the iterator forward by that many positions. Removing the element at i+2 is a strategic choice because it is the third occurrence of the number, thereby maintaining the first two occurrences.

The Return Statement

```
    }  
    return nums.size();
    }    
};
``` 
```}:``` This closes the for loop.

```return nums.size();```: After the loop finishes, all excess duplicates (more than two) have been removed. The function returns the current size of the nums vector, which represents the new length of the modified array.

```}```: This closes the removeDuplicates function.

```};```: This closes the Solution class definition.

This backward iteration approach is efficient for this problem because removing an element from a vector invalidates iterators from that point onward. By iterating backward, the indices of the elements that have not yet been checked remain valid. If you were to iterate forward and remove an element, the indices of all subsequent elements would shift, and the loop's logic would become incorrect.
