# Code Explanation

This C++ code defines a function removeDuplicates within a Solution class. Its purpose is to remove duplicate elements from a sorted std::vector<int> in-place. The function returns the new size of the vector after the duplicates have been removed.

**Line-by-Line Breakdown**

```
class Solution {
This line begins the definition of a class named Solution, which is standard practice for structuring code on platforms like LeetCode.
```

```
public:
```
The public access specifier indicates that the members (functions and variables) that follow can be accessed from outside the class.

```
int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
```
This line defines the removeDuplicates function.

```int```: The function returns an integer, which will be the size of the modified vector.

```removeDuplicates```: The function's name.

```vector<int>& nums```: The function takes a reference to a vector of integers as its parameter. The & symbol means the function operates directly on the original nums vector, and any changes made inside the function will persist.

```
for(int i=nums.size()-2; i>=0; i--){
```
This line initiates a for loop to iterate through the vector.

```int i=nums.size()-2```: The loop variable i is initialized to the second-to-last element's index. We start here because we will compare nums[i] with nums[i+1].

```i>=0```: The loop continues as long as i is greater than or equal to 0, ensuring that the loop checks every element from the second-to-last one down to the first.

```i--```: After each iteration, i is decremented by 1, moving the loop backward through the vector. This backward iteration is crucial to prevent issues caused by element shifting when using erase.

```
if (nums[i]==nums[i+1])
```
This is an if statement that checks for a duplicate. It compares the element at the current index i with the element immediately following it at index i+1. Since the vector is sorted, any duplicates will be adjacent.

```
{
    nums.erase(nums.begin() + (i+1));
}
```

If the if condition is true (a duplicate is found), this block is executed.

```nums.erase()```: This method removes an element from the vector.

```nums.begin() + (i+1)```: This calculates an iterator to the element at index i+1 (the second of the two duplicate elements). nums.begin() returns an iterator to the first element, and adding i+1 to it gets you to the desired position.

```
}
```
This bracket closes the for loop.

```
return nums.size();
```
After the loop completes, this line returns the final size of the vector, which now contains no duplicates.
