# 📘 LeetCode Solutions in C++

Welcome to my repository for **LeetCode interview questions solved in C++**.  
This project aims to provide clean solutions to a curated list of **LeetCode Top 150 Interview Questions**.  

The solutions are named **exactly as they are on LeetCode**, and each problem has its own dedicated folder.  
My initial goal is to provide a **brute-force solution** for each question, and I will later work on adding **optimized solutions** and their explanations.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each problem's folder will contain the following files:

- **`code.cpp`** → The complete C++ solution (brute-force initially, optimized versions later).  
- **`runtime.jpg` / `runtime.png`** → A visual representation of the runtime.  
- **`explanation.md`** → A line-by-line explanation of the C++ code.  

📌 Example folder structure for **Merge Sorted Array**:

```
leetcode/
└── Merge Sorted Array/
    ├── code.cpp
    ├── runtime.png
    └── explanation.md
└── README.md

```

## 🚀 My Journey

This repository is a part of my **personal journey** to become a better problem-solver and C++ developer.  
My goal is to **solidify my skills** by solving these classic interview problems.  

I hope that by sharing my **solutions** and **thought process**, I can also help others who are on a similar path.
